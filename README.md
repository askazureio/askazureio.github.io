# Welcome to the Ask Azure community!
Welcome to our community! We created this slack channel in an effort to foster a community, old and new, of users, customers, partners and employees who are using Azure. Here we share best practices, help work through designs and questions, share relevant content and help each other out. Think of us as a virtual user group, where we can all mingle to learn and share Azure-related content and questions.

Azure is massive and no one can know it all - don't hesitate to ask.

## Code of Conduct
*(Adapted from the [.NET Foundation's CoC](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct))* Our community slack was created to foster an open, innovative and inclusive community around learning and working with Microsoft Azure. To clarify expected behaviour in our communities we have adopted the Contributor Covenant. This code of conduct has been adopted by many other communities and we feel it expresses our values well. 

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery

- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct
- Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any contributions or content that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
